# Annotations Structure

This document describes the annotation format used for the BCData database, unified for the evaluation of the Ki-67 index using vision-language models (VLMs).

---

## General Format

Annotations are stored in `.json` files, one per image, each containing a list of cell objects, where 1 represent positive cells, and 2 represent negative cells:

```json
[
  {
    "x": x_val,
    "y": y_val,
    "label_id": 1
  },
  {
    "x": x_val,
    "y": y_val,
    "label_id": 2
  }
]
```
