The image shows breast tissue with cells stained for Ki-67. The brown nuclear staining indicates Ki-67 positive cells, while the blue nuclei represent Ki-67 negative cells.

After careful examination and counting:

- Immunopositive cells (brown nuclei): 22  
- Immunonegative cells (blue nuclei): 18  

Calculation:  
Ki-67 Index = (22 / (22 + 18)) × 100 = (22 / 40) × 100 = 55.00%

The image shows breast tissue with clear cellular structures. The brown nuclear staining indicates Ki-67 positive cells, while the blue nuclei represent Ki-67 negative cells.

After careful examination and counting:

- Immunopositive cells (brown nuclei): 58  
- Immunonegative cells (blue nuclei): 42  

Calculation:  
Ki-67 Index = (58 / (58 + 42)) × 100 = (58 / 100) × 100 = 58.00%

Upon careful examination of the provided histopathological image of breast tissue stained for Ki-67:

- The cells with brown nuclear staining (immunopositive) are clearly visible.
- The cells without brown nuclear staining (immunonegative) are also identifiable, showing lighter or blueish nuclei.

Counting the cells:

- Immunopositive cells: 38
- Immunonegative cells: 22

Calculation of Ki-67 index:

Ki-67 Index = (38 / (38 + 22)) x 100 = (38 / 60) x 100 = 63.33%

Immunopositive cells: 38
